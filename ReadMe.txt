Note: After users have entered data, you should not change the configuration of the reviews categories, number of reviews categories, number for the overall review and name of reviews categories because this will unlink the names from the data. Programming a way to link the names and the data seemed a bit time consuming, so I didn't. You can change all these parameters by uninstallig the module and starting over. Sorry for any inconvenience this might cause you.

Please see the FAQ on the GiantSpider Publisher Web site or contact the Webmaster at webmaster@giantspider.biz for support. Writing ReadMe files is tedious, so I didn't.

Regards,

Eric
